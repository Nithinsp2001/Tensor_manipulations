1. What patterns do you observe in the training and validation accuracy curves?
Observing the training and validation accuracy curves during model training can reveal several patterns:

Converging Curves: If both training and validation accuracy increase and plateau, it indicates the model is learning well.

Diverging Curves: If the training accuracy increases while the validation accuracy stagnates or decreases, it could indicate overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

Flat Curves: If both training and validation accuracy remain flat or very low, it may suggest underfitting, potentially due to an insufficient model architecture or poor feature representation.

Oscillations: Large oscillations in the curves might indicate an inappropriate learning rate or noisy data.
